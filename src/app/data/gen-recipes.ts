<p>The classic broke college student meal. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to prepare instant noodles:</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 package of instant noodles</li>
  <li>1 cup of water</li>
  <li>Optional: any leftover veggies, eggs, or seasonings you have lying around</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Boil some water: Fill a pot with 1 cup of water and put it on the stove. Turn the stove on high heat and wait for the water to boil. You can also use a microwave-safe bowl and heat the water in the microwave for 1-2 minutes, but be careful not to overheat it.</li>
  <li>Open the package: Rip open the package of instant noodles and pour the contents into a bowl.</li>
  <li>Add the seasoning: Open the seasoning packet that comes with the noodles and pour it into the bowl.</li>
  <li>Add the noodles: Pour the noodles into the bowl with the seasoning.</li>
  <li>Add the boiling water: Carefully pour the boiling water over the noodles and seasoning.</li>
  <li>Wait 2-3 minutes: Let the noodles sit for 2-3 minutes to allow them to cook.</li>
  <li>Stir and serve: Use a fork or spoon to stir the noodles and make sure they're not stuck together. Then, serve yourself and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Optional: Add some flair</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you have any leftover veggies, you can add them to the noodles for some extra nutrition. Just chop them up and throw them in.</li>
  <li>If you have an egg, you can crack it into the noodles and stir it in. This will add some protein and make the noodles slightly more filling.</li>
  <li>If you have any seasonings or sauces, you can add them to the noodles to give them some extra flavor. Just be careful not to overdo it, you don't want to overpower the delicate flavor of the instant noodles.</li>
</ul>
